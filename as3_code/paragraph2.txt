Others have tried the combinatorial technique to find new battery materials, but they have run into a stumbling block. The easy way to test thousands of materials is to deposit a sample of each one in a thin film atop a substrate. This approach did allow researchers to turn up promising materials for battery components but then candidates would typically prove unsuited to cost effective large scale production processes. To avoid that time wasting detour, samples are being produced using miniaturized versions of large scale production techniques.
