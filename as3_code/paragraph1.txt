Researchers have documented that people who take time out to help others are more inclined to think they can get everything done than those who do not. In one experiment, students were told they were going to be asked to help at risk kids write essays. Some of the students were then told that there were not enough participants so they could take the time off instead. The students who actually assisted on the essay writing turned out to have more confidence that they could get all their work done than those who were given unexpected leisure time.
